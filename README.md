# Law on wheels - Team 15 - Approved
Idea approved from Prof Ranjan:: Law on wheels

**1. Introduction to the problem statement**
Access to Legal services in India is very limited, especially in rural areas. In many cases, long running justice process and expensive legal help deter people even to seek justice. A Justice on wheels app(with lawyers network) that provides mobile (at your doorstep ) service for:

•	Rental Agreement Service
•	Mutual Divorse Service


**2. Approach**
 MOM (meeting with professor on 22nd Feb 2021)
 1. Create search based app
 2. Keep lawyers DB/network-validate it (currently no API available but with dummy data, certificates)
 3. start with few services
 4. Built website & convert to App using available tools & with major services.
 5. Get the knowledge of Law domain.

**3. Persona**
 1. Admin
 2. Users
 3. Lawyers

**4. Dataset links -NO**
