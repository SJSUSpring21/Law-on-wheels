Idea 1:

Justice on wheels

Access to Legal services in India is very limited, especially in rural areas. In many cases, long running justice process and expensive legal help deter people even to seek justice. A Justice on wheels app(with lawyers network) that provides mobile (at your doorstep ) service for:

•	Affidavit and stamp papers related work
•	Will and trust
•	Legal rights education 
•	Consumer protection related services and others

Idea 2:
Crop recommendation System  for farmers.

Idea 3: 
Dunzo
