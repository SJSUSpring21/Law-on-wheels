Idea 1:

Justice on wheels

Access to Legal services in India is very limited, especially in rural areas. In many cases, long running justice process and expensive legal help deter people even to seek justice. A Justice on wheels app(with lawyers network) that provides mobile (at your doorstep ) service for:

•	Affidavit and stamp papers related work
•	Will and trust
•	Legal rights education 
•	Consumer protection related services and others

Idea 2:
Crop recommendation System  for farmers.


The mainstream Indian population depends either explicitly or implicitly on agriculture for their livelihood.
A single farmer cannot be expected to take into account all the innumerable factors that contribute to crop growth before reaching a consensus about which one to grow.
A single misguided or imprudent decision by the farmer can have undesirable ramifications on both himself as well as the agricultural economy of the region.
Machine Learning can effectively help alleviate this issue.
We will build a system which intends to assist the Indian farmers in making an informed decision about which crop to grow depending on the sowing season, his farms geographical location, soil characteristics as well as environmental factors such as temperature and rainfall.

Idea 3: 

Owner Resource Carrier Pool
