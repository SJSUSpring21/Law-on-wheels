Idea 1:

Justice on wheels

Access to Legal services in India is very limited, especially in rural areas. In many cases, long running justice process and expensive legal help deter people even to seek justice. A Justice on wheels app(with lawyers network) that provides mobile (at your doorstep ) service for:

•	Affidavit and stamp papers related work
•	Will and trust
•	Legal rights education 
•	Consumer protection related services and others

Idea 2:
Crop recommendation System  for farmers.


The mainstream Indian population depends either explicitly or implicitly on agriculture for their livelihood.
A single farmer cannot be expected to take into account all the innumerable factors that contribute to crop growth before reaching a consensus about which one to grow.
A single misguided or imprudent decision by the farmer can have undesirable ramifications on both himself as well as the agricultural economy of the region.
Machine Learning can effectively help alleviate this issue.
We will build a system which intends to assist the Indian farmers in making an informed decision about which crop to grow depending on the sowing season, his farms geographical location, soil characteristics as well as environmental factors such as temperature and rainfall.

Idea 3: 
Owner Resource Carrier Pool is a tool that can be used by the common people to find an easy way to get their belongings to their current place without physically going back to their residence.
The software’s database will consist of the data of users residing in the vicinity of your residence.

Background
-People in busy metropolitan cities commonly face the problem of forgetting their essentials at their residence while they’re working.
-Instead of going and bringing it back, this software provides a delivery guy for the purpose.
-It delivery guy can be any person (local resident) traveling on the same path as your residence to workplace route vice versa.
-If there is no one traveling to the destination from the source area, the software can recommend/provide you a guy 
-The beneficiaries of this software can be any person who is in need of help in that area.

Objective
-As a part of this proposal, we hope to achieve the development of a system that can provide a felicitous atmosphere to users.
-Users of this software shall be able to receive their belongings with the same ease with which modern-day users receive food deliveries.
-With the help of this software social fabric of a balanced society shall be enhanced with an increase in the bond of people to help each other in a situation of disarray.
