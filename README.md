# Justice on wheels - Team 15 - Approved
Idea approved from Prof Ranjan:: Justice on wheels

**1. Introduction to the problem statement**
Access to Legal services in India is very limited, especially in rural areas. In many cases, long running justice process and expensive legal help deter people even to seek justice. A Justice on wheels app(with lawyers network) that provides mobile (at your doorstep ) service for:

•	Affidavit and stamp papers related work
•	Will and trust
•	Legal rights education 
•	Consumer protection related services and others
